# Inheritance

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a new class (called a subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from an existing class (called a superclass or base class). This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.

The layers of inheritance should not exceed 3-4 levels to maintain code readability and manageability.
